# CiviCRM Proximity
Geographical proximity search for CiviCRM.
Based on the original code by @qjensen: https://github.com/qjensen/CiviCRM-Proximity-Search

The latest changes allow the module to be compatible with Drupal 7, and also add other improvements, like providing an
admin form for entering the API Key for the Google service.

# Configuration

Before enabling the module it is necessary to enable geocoding in your CiviCRM
database and run the script that populates those fields.
