CiviCRM Proximity Search

CiviCRM provides proximity search functionality on CiviCRM forms, but this is not 
availalbe via Views. CiviCRM Proximity Search borrows heavily from the OpenLayers Proximity
project to add this functionality to CiviCRM contact searches in Views.

Please make sure the CiviCRM is installed and functioning correctly and that you have enabled
GeoCoding in CiviCRM. If you need help, instructions can be found at
